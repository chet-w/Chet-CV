                    Hi, my names Chet and I'm a 3rd year Computer Science Student with a passion for 
                    Software and Web Development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm a focussed team player capable of picking up new things quickly and performing 
                    well under unfamiliar and challenging situations. I have a deep interest in design 
                    and front end development, and hope to apply my skills and visions to create 
                    great User Interfaces and provide a pleasing User Experience. I have years of 
                    experience working in teams, communicating with customers, and working hard to 
                    provide a top-quality solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of working, I enjoy cricket, reading, keeping up to date with new 
                    technology, board games and puzzles, and walking around my home city of
                    Wellington.

                    At Victoria I expanded my interest in development and software by studying Software Engineering and Computer Science.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Critical courses for Algorithms & Data Structures, Software Correctness, User Interface and User Experience Design, and Software Development 
                    were all key in growing my understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked in teams and on my own to understand how Software is designed, developed, and tested.

                    During my time at Victoria University I became fluent with Java, using it heavily 
                    for most of my work in Computer Science. My interest in Web Design encouraged me 
                    to continue my learning of HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript independantly after my 
                    courses of required use with them were completed. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Professionally I gained many of my skills from my work in group and individual  projects in various courses as well as from my time as a Sales Consultant at 
                    Noel Leeming. Here I worked alongside people of various backgrounds to help 
                    everyday customers find solutions to fit their needs, developing key skills like 
                    leadership, communication, working in a team, and working towards a solution in 
                    challenging situations.

                          I began my work for Noel Leeming in the Technology branch working solely

                          developed my communication skills and my ability to work with others in a

                          I joined brand new team in 2015 in the heart of Wellington's CBD, and as an 
                          experienced staff member I played an active role in helping new staff and 
                          demonstrating leadership when possible. I learnt cash handling skills, stock 
                          management, health and safety protocols, and financial responsibilities with 
                          credit and lending as a Sales Consultant.

                          The transition to what was now my third branch meant that I had to learn to 
                          adapt to changing working environments and think on my feet when put into 
                          teams with completely new people of varying levels of experience.

                      Spooky School was a project that took place over six weeks in the second half

                      trying to steal his exam results from a secure room in a Spooky School.

                      Kelburn Post Smart (KPS) was a project completed over eight weeks in the first half 
                      of 2015. It is a web-app used to send mail and manage the workings of a fictional 
                      mail service, including features such as updating cost-price information, and 
                      viewing accurate real-time statistics from the application.

                  <p>
                      The application is built on a HTML5 backbone, published in Jade, while using 
                      JavaScript to communicate to a backend SQL database. Working with four other students for this project, I worked as chief front end developer for this project creating all the visual elements on the interface, and was second in command for management, stepping in for our Projet Leader when he was unavailable.
